# Unlocking-the-Potential-of-Machine-Learning-for-Accurate-Diagnosis-of-Breast-Cancer

Abstractâ€”Breast cancer is a major health concern affecting
women globally, and early detection is crucial for successful
treatment. A promising strategy for enhancing breast cancer
diagnosis accuracy and lowering diagnostic mistakes is machine
learning. This research aims to enhance the accuracy of breast
cancer diagnosis by utilizing balanced data and comparing
different machine learning algorithms for classification with
and without the use of feature selection methods. In this study,
we utilized the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)
dataset, and to balance data both oversampling and
undersampling techniques were utilized. We have used eight
different classification models and five different feature
selection techniques. We compared the performance of
classifiers over undersampled and oversampled data, with and
without feature selection. MLflow was utilized to monitor the
effectiveness of algorithms and keep a record of their
performance. Our results show that oversampling was more
effective in improving the performance of our models compared
to undersampling. When compared to other models, Logistic
Regression achieved the highest accuracy on the oversampled
data without feature selection. Our research showed that
incorporating feature selection results in slightly lower accuracy
compared to the base model which means that the results were
not significant enough to compensate for the information loss
caused by removing certain features. The study underscores the
efficacy of machine learning in the diagnosis of breast cancer
and draws attention to the potential of machine learning
algorithms in enhancing the accuracy of cancer detection.
